                <p>
                    At this humble attempt, I’d like to describe myself as a highly motivated, ambitious and
                    hard-working individual with an extensive background in business administration.
                    Thanks to my English fluency and a variety of useful skills, I’ve been proven to exceed performance
                    expectations, maintain the ability to bring about fundamental changes needed in response to various
                    circumstances and acquire a strong strategic vision along with the capability to tackle complex
                    tasks. For a long time, I’ve been showing intense interest in the world of programming and upon
                    finding this golden opportunity, I know I must not let this chance slip away easily.
                    Thus, I strongly believe that I can effectively contribute all I’ve got to your company at my best.
                    I sincerely thank you for your time and review. I wish you a great day and look forward to
                    co-operating with you soon
